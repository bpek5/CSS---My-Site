        I'm someone who wants to learn everything there is to know about the world of tech and life!
        From software 3D design, to software development, to automobile engines,
        nothing can stop me from learning!

        <p class="code-skill-description">
          I always wanted to learn how to make and fix things since I was a kid.
          From cardboard swords, to 3D modeling and 3Dprinting, to code and webapplications,
          I love learning new tools and experiences to better my understanding of life
          and finding ways to apply newly acquired skills into reality! Life's all about learning and teaching.
          As long as I have my passion to learn, then everyday is a new day.

        <h3>Problem? No problem.</h3>
        <p class="skill-2-description">
          There are always issues and problems around me and everyone. They range from physical entities like creaky doors or
          broken cars, to abstract entities like time and responsibleness. Whenever I see someone struggle working their computer, I'm not afraid to insert myself
          into the situation and help fix it. As I come across problems of my own, I try to find the most simple and efficient way to go about solving it.
          Since solving the problem is half of the battle, explaining how I went about it is another. The best way I learned to explain
          my thought process is to break them up into analogies and deliver them using common household items or common life experiences.
